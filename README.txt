README.TXT

All files written and (c)2014 Ken Peck.

The files contained herein are intended for educational purposes only. If you want to use
trees in some production environment, I suggest you use a professionally-developed
library, as the code in those libraries is much better and far more complete than what I
have written here.

For a list of terms and conditions, please see LICENSE.TXT

----

The file tree-vXX.jar represents the archive containing the source code for the actual
tree program. It is heavily documented (especially Tree.java).

If you want a convenient html formatted version of the documentation, just open
javadoc/index.html in your favorite web browser.

Happy hacking!
